# Lawn Paynes

## Purpose
This iteration of the LawnPaynes webpage is an advancement of a proposal page for a friend's lawn care business. It expands on the 
previous iteration of that project [https://ryansallee.github.io](https://ryansallee.github.io/) by using EF and the ASP MVC .NET 
to build a Customer Manager that allows the site owner to add customers, locations for those customers, a list of services that can
be associated with a customer's location. As well, customers can use the Contact Form to submit their basic information to inquire 
about being a customer or an existing customer can submit changes to their information.
